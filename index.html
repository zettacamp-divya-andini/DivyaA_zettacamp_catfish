        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;"> Doctor Strange had its world premiere in 
            <b>Hong Kong on October 13, 2016, </b> 
            and was released in the United States on November 4, as part of Phase Three of the MCU</p>
        <p style="color:green ; text-align: center;"> Strange can alter time around objects, locations or other beings,
             moving forward and backward through their existence. It can also be used to trap enemies in time loops,
             as well as giving Strange the ability to look forward into potential futures.</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Doctor Stephen Vincent Strange, M.D., Ph.D is a Master of the Mystic Arts.
             Originally being a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, 
             Strange got into a car accident which resulted with his hands becoming crippled.
              Once Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey to Kamar-Taj,
               where he was trained by the Ancient One in the ways of Magic and the Multiverse.
                Although he focused on healing his hands, Strange was drawn into a 
                conflict with Kaecilius and the Zealots,
                 who were working for Dormammu and had sought to merge Earth with
                  the Dark Dimension to find an eternal life.
                  Following the demise of the Ancient One and the defeat of Kaecilius, 
                  Strange then became the new protector for the Sanctum Sanctorum, 
            seeking to defend the Earth from other inter-dimensional threats.</p>
