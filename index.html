        <h1>Werewolf Cards</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Werewolf is a super fun party game that can be played with a large group of people. 
            The object of the game is to identify and kill the werewolves amongst the villagers. 
            Start by shuffling and dealing out the game cards, making sure to include 2 werewolves, a Doctor,
             and a Seer card. There are also wild cards that can be played such as the Drunk, the Witch, and 
             the Alpha Werewolf. Then, the night phase begins and the moderator has the werewolves choose a victim, 
             the Doctor is allowed to save 1 person, and the Seer gets to guess at 1 person they suspect of being a
              werewolf. When the night round ends, the day round begins and the players discuss their characters
               and then take a vote on who they believe is a werewolf. That player is then killed and the night round
                begins again. The game continues until either the werewolves or the villagers win.
             A popular version of the game called One Night: Ultimate Werewolf has even more roles that can be played.</p>
